🧠 **About Me**

I hold a PhD in Economics from Jawaharlal Nehru University and currently serve as an Associate Research Fellow at the Institute for Human Development in New Delhi. 

My research focuses on the policy impacts within the health sector and the exploration of health-related decision-making, particularly under conditions of risk and uncertainty. I employ valuation techniques such as stated preference surveys and discrete choice experiments. This comprehensive approach allows me to integrate my expertise in health economics with interdisciplinary fields, including environment, education, and labor economics.
