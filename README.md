### 🧠 About Me

I hold a **PhD in Economics from Jawaharlal Nehru University** and currently serve as an **Associate Research Fellow** at the *Institute for Human Development, New Delhi*.

My research examines how individuals and households make health-related decisions in contexts of risk and uncertainty, with a focus on evaluating the equity and effectiveness of health and development policies. I apply empirical tools such as stated preference methods, discrete choice experiments, and econometric modeling, often intersecting with issues in education, labor markets, and environmental health.
